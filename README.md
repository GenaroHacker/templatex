# Templatex

Welcome to **Templatex**, a simple tool that utilizes the builder pattern to create LaTeX scripts designed for printing and handwriting purposes. Generate organized and structured LaTeX documents through an easy-to-use Python interface. Includes a Jupyter notebook.

## Usage

Start using Templatex directly in your browser using Google Colab:

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/GenaroHacker/templatex/blob/main/main.ipynb)

**Features:**
- Modular Building Blocks: Utilize different builders to add sections, text, and hand-written input areas.
- Dynamic LaTeX Generation: Create documents programmatically with customized sections and spacing.


After running the script, download the file `output.tex` from the notebook and run `pdflatex output.tex` on your local machine to generate the document. Note that you must have LaTeX installed on your system to execute this command.

For an example of the expected output, you can click on [example.pdf](https://github.com/GenaroHacker/templatex/blob/main/examples/example.pdf).
